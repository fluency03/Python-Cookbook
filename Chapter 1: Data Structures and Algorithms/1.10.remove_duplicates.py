# 1.10. Removing Duplicates from a Sequence while Maintaining Order
# Problem: You want to eliminate the duplicate values in a sequence, 
# but preserve the order of the remaining items.

# Iterating over the list and the generator looks completely the same. 
# However, although the generator is iterable, it is not a collection, 
# and thus has no length. Collections (lists, tuples, sets, etc) keep 
# all values in memory and we can access them whenever needed. 
# A generator calculates the values on the fly and forgets them, 
# so it does not have any overview about the own result set.
